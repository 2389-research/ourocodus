# Agent Runtime Architecture

## Overview

The agent runtime layer manages the lifecycle and execution environment for AI coding agents. This layer provides isolation, resource management, and workspace coordination through Docker containers.

**Key Components:**
- Session Manager: Tracks UserSessions and spawns AgentSessions
- ContainerSession Manager: Creates and manages Docker containers for agent execution
- Agent Launcher: Coordinates agent spawning and ACP protocol initialization

## Session Type Definitions

These are the authoritative definitions for session types in Ourocodus:

### UserSession

**Definition:** A WebSocket connection from the PWA (browser) to the Relay server.

**Characteristics:**
- Represents a single user's connection to the system
- Contains 0 to N AgentSessions
- Lifecycle: Established on WebSocket connect, terminated on disconnect
- Tracked by: `pkg/relay/session.Store`

**Example:**
- User opens PWA in browser → UserSession created
- User spawns 3 agents → UserSession contains 3 AgentSessions
- User closes browser → UserSession terminated, all AgentSessions cleaned up

### AgentSession

**Definition:** An individual AI agent process with its own workspace and execution state.

**Characteristics:**
- One per agent spawned by the user
- Has dedicated workspace directory (git worktree)
- Communicates via ACP (Agent Client Protocol)
- Runs inside a ContainerSession for isolation
- Tracked by: `pkg/relay/session.Manager`

**Lifecycle:**
1. User requests agent spawn
2. AgentSession created with unique ID
3. ContainerSession created for execution environment
4. Agent process launched inside container
5. Agent processes tasks via ACP messages
6. User terminates agent → AgentSession and ContainerSession cleaned up

### ContainerSession

**Definition:** A Docker container managed by `pkg/containersession` that provides the runtime environment for an AgentSession.

**Characteristics:**
- **Lifecycle Policy:** One ContainerSession per AgentSession (1:1 mapping)
- Provides process isolation and resource management
- Mounts workspace directory from host
- Receives credentials via environment variables
- Automatically cleaned up when AgentSession terminates
- Managed by: `pkg/containersession.Manager`

**Container Configuration:**
- Image: Configurable (typically contains Claude Code ACP binary)
- Workspace: Bind-mounted from host filesystem
- Network: Default Docker bridge network
- Credentials: Injected via environment variables
- Lifecycle: Created on agent spawn, destroyed on agent termination
